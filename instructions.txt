CSCI 310 GUI & GAME
Project 3: C# Console Game
Goal: In this project, you will design and implement an interactive console-based game using
C#. The game should run entirely in the console window and provide a responsive and engaging
gameplay experience. While the inspiration comes from classic block-based games, you are not
allowed to recreate Tetris. You are encouraged to be creative and implement your own unique
game mechanics.
Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
● Practice working with C# console input/output, including reading keys and controlling
console display.
● Implement real-time game logic.
● Design game state management, including handling starting, running, and game-over
states.
● Apply OO design and programming for a complete game.
Requirements:
Regardless of your chosen game type, every interactive console game shares fundamental
components. Consider these abstractions as you design and build. Your game must include the
following functional features:
● Game Interaction
○ Use keyboard input for player control or value entry.
○ Design and Implement a start menu or prompt (e.g., “Press any key to start the
game”).
○ Design Implement a game-over panel or message showing the final score.
● Gameplay Mechanics
○ The game must have dynamic and real-time updates (e.g., moving objects, timers,
falling pieces, scoring, game values, or enemies).
○ Enforce playable boundary constraints: there is a playable area, for showing
values, objects, or etc. Showing what things depends on your game types.
○ Can allow actions such as moving, rotating, shooting, or dropping items,
depending on your game concept (optional)
● Game State and Score
○ Track score, level, or other relevant game metrics.
○ Update the game state based on player actions and game rules.
○ Provide restart and quit functionality at game-over.
■ Start/End States: Consider how your game begins (e.g., immediate start)
and how it might conclude (e.g., achieving a goal, running out of lives).
While full overlay UIs are not required for this simplified approach, a
simple console log or on-screen text for "Game Over" is sufficient.
■ Reset Mechanism: Provide a way to reset the game to its initial state (e.g.,
by pressing a specific key like 'R'), allowing for replayability.
● Technical Requirements
○ The game must be written in C# and run in the console application.
○ Do NOT use any graphical libraries (e.g., Unity, WinForms, WPF) or APIs, it will
NOT work.
○ Implement smooth gameplay, avoiding freezing or blocking input unnecessarily.
■ You may need to use async input handling or Console.KeyAvailable loop
for non-blocking gameplay.
● Scoring & Feedback
● Progress Tracking: There should be at least one indicator to show the game
progress.
○ Ex: score based on targets hit, items collected, or time survived.
● Visual Feedback (optional): Provide clear visual feedback to the player if needed
(e.g., objects disappearing upon impact, score updates, or simple color changes).
Suggestions
● Creativity is encouraged: your game can be puzzle-based, action-based, simulation, or
other genres suitable for a console interface.
● Focus on correct and smooth gameplay, even if graphics are minimal.
● Pay attention to edge cases such as game-over conditions and simultaneous key presses.
● You are welcome to improve our class’ sample console games.
Grading Policy (100pts + 15pts)
● Fulfill above requirements (70pts)
a. Game functionality and playability
b. Input handling and responsiveness
c. Smooth operations and game flow
● Visuals Design (10pts)
● Code organization and readability (10pts)
● Uniqueness and creativity (10pts)
● Bonus (15pts) – very fun and creative
Presentation (20pts)
● Prepare for a 5 minute presentation (i.e., 5 minutes for presentation + 1 minutes Q&A)
● Show how you develop the game
● Individual contributions if you have a team
● Demonstrate your game and show you follow the requirements
Developer Notebook (30pts)
● Follow the specification and document your development well.
Each item will be graded based on:
● Well-completed (100%)
● Completed (85-100%)
● Developing (75-85%)
● Progressing (60-75%)
● Under-developed (under 60%)
Individual contribution:
Grading will be also based on individual contributions in the team. Team members who
contribute almost equally will receive the same contribution scores.
Submission:
● Submit your program, developer notebook, and presentation to BrightSpace.
